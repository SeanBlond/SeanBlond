## Current Projects
Right now I'm working on [Blunder](https://github.com/SeanBlond/Blunder), an open source Rendering Software centered around customizable shader code. It's in it's very early stages right now, and isn't really useable.
I also have dreams of one day making an open source Adobe Lightroom alternative, but that's a future project for after Blunder.
